Bun is a modern JavaScript runtime like Node or Deno. It was built from scratch to focus on three main things:
â€¢ Start fast (it has the edge in mind).
â€¢ New levels of performance (extending JavaScriptCore, the engine).
â€¢ Being a great and complete tool (bundler, transpiler, package manager).

To fix this error, you need to update Linux kernel.
If you are using the Windows Subsystem for Linux, do:
  **1.** Open powershell as administrator
  **2.** Run:
     â€¢ wsl --set-version <distro name> 2

**Illegal instruction - core dumped**

Bun currently only works on CPUs supporting the AVX2 instruction set.
To run on older CPUs this can be emulated using Intel SDE, however bun won't be as fast as it would be when running on CPUs with AVX2 support.
If you get this error while bun is initializing, you probably need to wrap the bun executable with intel-sde.

**1.** Install intel-sde:
   â€¢ Arch Linux: `yay -S intel-sde`
   â€¢ Other Distros:
```bash
wget https://downloadmirror.intel.com/732268/sde-external-9.7.0-2022-05-09-lin.tar.xz -O /tmp/intel-sde.tar.xz
cd /tmp
tar -xf intel-sde.tar.xz
cd sde-external*
mkdir /usr/local/bin -p
cp sde64 /usr/local/bin/sde
cp -r intel64 /usr/local/bin/
cp -r misc /usr/local/bin/
```

**2.** Add alias to bashrc
   â€¢ `echo "alias bun='sde -chip-check-disable -- bun'" >> ~/.bashrc`
